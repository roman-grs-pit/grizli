#Notes when setting up for Roman

#Ashley needed to install wget on his computer 
#Kevin M. sonoma 14.6 M3 used homebrew to install wget with ‘brew install wget’)

#One likely will want to use a new conda environment, e.g., Kevin M. used

conda create -n roman python=3.10
conda activate roman

#grizli install suggests python 3.9, this works for Greg

#git clone and install grizli
git clone https://github.com/roman-grs-pit/grizli.git
cd grizli
pip install -e .
mkdir CONF
mkdir templates
pip install ".[test]"

#pytest never work for Kevin M. , but that didn't actually seem to matter for running anything 
#numpy version was then incompatible with astropy and this was needed
pip install --force-reinstall numpy==1.26

#this was required for Ashley (he was not previously running much of anything on his laptop!) needed before pip install ".[test]" and pytest worked:
conda install hdf5
conda install setuptools

#following Keith's notebook, not actually needed
conda install pysynphot
export PYSYN_CDBS="${HOME}/pysyn_cdbs"
mkdir $PYSYN_CDBS
wget http://ssb.stsci.edu/trds/tarfiles/synphot5.tar.gz -O $PYSYN_CDBS/grid/phoenix/synphot5.tar.gz #this is a large file that takes a long time to download, ~30 minutes; might not be actually be needed for basic applications
cd $PYSYN_CDBS
tar xzvf synphot5.tar.gz

pip install webbpsf
export WEBBPSF_PATH="${HOME}/webbpsf-data" 
mkdir $WEBBPSF_PATH 
#download webpsf-data-LATEST.tar.gz and move it to ../$WEBBPSF_PATH ; basic wget on the link doesn't work because it actually some box address, some worry that this could change when we try to put it in automated install scripts
cd ../$WEBBPSF_PATH
tar xzvf webbpsf-data-LATEST.tar.gz

conda install synphot -c conda-forge #not sure this was necessary
pip install stsynphot


#Roman data to use is here:
https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/theory/Roman/Wang2022a/products/configuration/

#environment variable to always set
export PYSYN_CDBS="${HOME}/pysyn_cdbs"
export WEBBPSF_PATH="${HOME}/webbpsf-data"
