#Notes when setting up for Roman

#Ashley needed to install wget on his computer 
#Kevin M. used homebrew to install wget with ‘brew install wget’)

#One likely will want to use a new conda environment, e.g., Kevin M. used

conda create -n roman python=3.10
conda activate roman

#grizli install suggests python 3.9, this work for Greg

#git clone and install grizli
git clone https://github.com/roman-grs-pit/grizli.git
cd grizli
pip install -e .
mkdir CONF
mkdir templates
pip install ".[test]"

#this was required for Kevin M. to fix issue with pytest failing sonoma 14.6 M3
pip install --force-reinstall numpy==1.26

#this was required for Ashley (he was not previously running much of anything on his laptop!) needed before pip install ".[test]" and pytest worked:
conda install hdf5
conda install setuptools

#following Keith's notebook
conda install pysynphot
export PYSYN_CDBS="${HOME}/pysyn_cdbs"
mkdir $PYSYN_CDBS
wget http://ssb.stsci.edu/trds/tarfiles/synphot5.tar.gz -O $PYSYN_CDBS/grid/phoenix/synphot5.tar.gz #this is a large file that takes a long time to download, ~30 minutes
cd $PYSYN_CDBS
tar xzvf synphot5.tar.gz

pip install webbpsf
export WEBBPSF_PATH="${HOME}/webbpsf-data" 
mkdir $WEBBPSF_PATH 
#download webpsf-data-LATEST.tar.gz and move it to ../$WEBBPSF_PATH 
cd ../$WEBBPSF_PATH
tar xzvf webbpsf-data-LATEST.tar.gz

conda install synphot -c conda-forge #not sure this was necessary
pip install stsynphot


#Roman data to use is here:
https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/theory/Roman/Wang2022a/products/configuration/

#environment variable to always set
